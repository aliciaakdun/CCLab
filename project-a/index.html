                <p>The Crawlers are a group that values each other's well being the most. However, they are an invasive
                    species desctructive to
                    the environment and need to be erradicated on sight.</p>

                Crawlers can be found underground everywhere in the world. They are currently posing a threat to human
                infrastructures, as their digging impacts dirt and sand density. There have been numerous reports of
                crawlers swarming after one of their groupmates is destroyed, as well as more crawlers emerging from
                dead ones. Crawlers do not need food, water, or oxygen to survive, and can withstand an incredible
                amount of weight and pressure, making them almost impossible to kill. The only known method of
                destruction is using a small explosive device to blow them up one by one.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Click on the crawlers to
                make them explode. Other crawlers will swarm towards dead crawlers in a panic, making them predictable
                targets. Careful, large crawlers will release two smaller crawlers. If you click on large dead crawlers,
                they will keep spawning smaller crawlers, so do not spam. The goal is to eradicate all crawlers as fast
                as possible.
